            <p>
                Year over year visits to Cytoscape.org are increasing, and have recovered relative to the dip in the second half of 2016 (temporary suspension of AdWords). 2018 seems to be showing an increase over 2017.

                Over time, the USA remains a top visitor to Cytoscape.org. However, “Other” visits more often, meaning that the entire world (outside of the top 10 visiting countries) visits more often. Compared to last year, the biggest jump in overall share is from
                China and India.
