                    <strong><i>Cytoscape</i></strong> is an open source software platform for <strong><i>
                    visualizing</i></strong> molecular interaction networks and biological pathways and
                    <strong><i>integrating</i></strong> these networks with annotations, gene expression
                    profiles and other state data. Although Cytoscape was originally designed for
                    biological research, now it is a general platform for complex network analysis and
                    visualization. &nbsp; Cytoscape <i>core</i> distribution provides a basic set of features
                    for data integration, analysis, and visualization. &nbsp; Additional features are available as
                    <strong><i>Apps</i></strong> (formerly called <i>Plugins</i>). &nbsp; Apps are available
                    for network and molecular profiling analyses, new layouts, additional file format support,
                    scripting, and connection with databases. &nbsp; They may be developed by anyone using the
                    Cytoscape open API based on <a href="http://www.java.com/en/" target="_blank">Java&#8482;</a>
                    technology and App community development is encouraged. Most of the Apps are
                    freely available from <a href="http://apps.cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape App Store</a>.

                    <strong><i>Cytoscape 3</i> is the mainstream version of Cytoscape with modular architecture</strong>.
                    It is designed for long-term maintainability and it replaced 2.x series.  It is a Java desktop application 
                    designed for large-scale network analysis and visualization.
                    New features, including new user interfaces, advanced visualization functions, headless
                    (command-line)
                    distribution, RESTful API, and multiple rendering engine support, will be released
                    for this version. As of November 2015, transition from Cytoscape 2.x to 3.x is almost complete. 
                    Many Apps are now available for Cytoscape 3, and third party App developers
                    are working hard to port remaining 2.x plugins to 3.x series.

                    <a href="http://cytoscapeweb.cytoscape.org">Cytoscape Web</a>. Cytoscape.js is a <strong>JavaScript
                    library</strong> for network visualization and analysis, and is <strong>NOT a complete web
                    application</strong>. Cytoscape 3 and cytoscape.js share design-level concepts, such as Visual
                    Styles,
                    but their code bases are completely independent to each other. It is designed to be a building block
                    for
                    complex
                    data visualization web applications for the HTML5 era.
                    The Cytoscape core developer team is trying to improve interoperability of Cytoscape 3 and
                    Cytoscape.js. 
                    From
                    Cytoscape 3.2, users can export network visualizations as interactive web application using
                    Cytoscape.js.

                    <strong>Cytoscape 2.x</strong> is a legacy version of Cytoscape. This version is in

                        in the field for several years and will be supported into the future, but over
                        time, v3.x and successors will be better supported. Use v2.x if you have used
                        v2.x in the past and rely on a plugin not supported as a v3.x app in the App
                        Store – keep checking the App Store for new arrivals.

                        <strong>App Developers:</strong> Please port your 2.x Apps to 3.x series. We recommend to use

                <p>
                    Cytoscape supports a lot of standard network and annotation file formats including: SIF
                    (Simple Interaction Format), <a href="http://www.infosun.fim.uni-passau.de/Graphlet/GML/"> GML</a>,

                    Delimited text files and MS Excel&#8482; Workbook are also supported and you can import
                    data files, such as expression profiles or <a href="http://www.geneontology.org">GO</a> annotations,
                    generated by other applications
                    or spreadsheet programs. Using this feature, you can load and save arbitrary attributes
                    on nodes, edges, and networks. For example, input a set of custom annotation terms for
                    your proteins, create a set of confidence values for your protein-protein interactions.

                <p>
                    Cytoscape works as a web service client. This means Cytoscape can directly connect to
                    the external public databases and imports network and annotation data. Currently, <a
                        href="http://www.pathwaycommons.org/pc/">Pathway Commons</a>, <a
                        href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/site/index.jsf">IntAct</a>, <a

                    are supported. And we continue to
                    develop new service clients for popular databases.

                    Since Cytoscape supports import/export standard file formats, you can easily put Cytoscape
                    into your workflow. For example, if you have a network data generated by
                    <a href="http://cneurocvs.rmki.kfki.hu/igraph/">igraph</a> or
                    <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/GraphsAndNetworks.html">Bioconductor</a>,
                    Cytoscape can load the file as a text table and you can export it in PSI-MI format for
                    other bioinformatics tools or your own applications/scripts.

                    eye view</i> to easily navigate large networks. Easily navigate large networks (100,000+ nodes and
                    edges) by efficient rendering engine.

                <p>
                    <strong>Find active subnetworks/pathway modules</strong>. The network is screened against gene
                    expression
                    data to identify connected sets of interactions, i.e. <i>interaction subnetworks</i>, whose genes
                    show
                    particularly high levels of differential expression. &nbsp;The interactions contained in each
                    subnetwork
                    provide hypotheses for the regulatory and signaling interactions in control of the observed
                    expression
                    changes. <strong>Find clusters (highly interconnected regions)</strong> in any network loaded into
                    Cytoscape. Depending on the type of network, clusters may mean different things. For instance,
                    clusters in a
                    protein-protein interaction network have been shown to be protein complexes and parts of pathways.
                    Clusters
                    in a protein similarity network represent protein families.

                    <strong><a href="http://apps.cytoscape.org">Apps</a></strong> are available for network and
                    molecular
                    profile analysis. Cytoscape is a software written in Java and you can write your own
                    App for data analysis, import, and visualization by writing Java code. More Apps are
                    available at the <a href="http://apps.cytoscape.org">Cytoscape App Store</a>.
                    You can install most of the Apps by just one click from <i>App Manager</i>, or directly install
                    from the App Store (this is a Cytoscape 3 feature).
