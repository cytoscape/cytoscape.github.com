                <p class="lead">
                    <strong><i>Cytoscape</i></strong> is an open source software platform for <strong><i>
                    visualizing</i></strong> molecular interaction networks and biological pathways and
                    <strong><i>integrating</i></strong> these networks with annotations, gene expression
                    profiles and other state data. Although Cytoscape was originally designed for
                    biological research, now it is a general platform for complex network analysis and
                    visualization. &nbsp; Cytoscape <i>core</i> distribution provides a basic set of features
                    for data integration, analysis, and visualization. &nbsp; Additional features are available as
                    <strong><i>Apps</i></strong> (formerly called <i>Plugins</i>). &nbsp; Apps are available
                    for network and molecular profiling analyses, new layouts, additional file format support,
                    scripting, and connection with databases. &nbsp; They may be developed by anyone using the
                    Cytoscape open API based on <a href="http://www.java.com/en/" target="_blank">Java&#8482;</a>
                    technology and App community development is encouraged. Most of the Apps are
                    freely available from <a href="http://apps.cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape App Store</a>.

                    As of February 2014, there are three versions of Cytoscape:
                    <strong>Cytoscape 2.x, <a href="cy3.html">Cytoscape 3.x</a>, and
                        <a href="http://cytoscape.github.com/cytoscape.js/index.html">cytoscape.js</a></strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>3.x</strong> is the whole new version of Cytoscape with modular architecture.
                    It is designed for long-term maintainability and eventually it replaces 2.x series.
                    New major features, including new user interfaces, headless (command-line)
                    distribution, and multiple rendering engine support, will be released
                    for this version. Currently, Cytoscape community is in the middle of transition
                    from 2.x to 3.x. Core and third party App developers are working hard to port as much as 2.x
                    features and Apps to 3.x series.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Cytoscape 2.x</strong> is a legacy version of Cytoscape. This version is in
                    maintenance mode and new features will not be added by the core developers. If you need to
                    use a specific plugin in your workflow, you may need to use this version.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <a href="http://cytoscape.github.com/cytoscape.js/index.html">cytoscape.js</a> is a successor of
                    <a href="http://cytoscapeweb.cytoscape.org">Cytoscape Web</a>. cytoscape.js is a JavaScript
                    library for network visualization, <strong>NOT a complete web application</strong>.
                    It shares some design-level concepts with Desktop (Java) version of Cytoscape, but code base is
                    completely independent. It is designed to be a building block for complex
                    data visualization web applications for the HTML5 era.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Users, Casual Users, and Power Users:</strong> Use Cytoscape v3.x -- v2.x has been
                        in the field for several years and will be supported into the future, but over
                        time, v3.x and successors will be better supported. Use v2.x if you have used
                        v2.x in the past and rely on a plugin not supported as a v3.x app in the App
                        Store – keep checking the App Store for new arrivals.

                    <li>
                        <strong>App Developers:</strong> Please port your 2.x Apps to 3.x series. We recommend to use
                        3.x for new plugins development. <a href="http://chianti.ucsd.edu/cytoscape-3.0.1/API/">3.x

                        is stable enough to develop new Apps,
                        but if you notice any design flaws or bugs,

                        <strong>Web Application Developers:</strong> You can use cytoscape.js as network data
                        visualization
                        engine for your web application. It is a pure JavaScript library and no plugin
                        is required for the web browsers. In the long term, this library and other
                        server-side applications replaces Java Web Start version of Cytoscape.

        <p>
            <img src="images/intro_3.png"/>
        </p>

        <p>
            Cytoscape supports a lot of standard network and annotation file formats including: SIF
            (Simple Interaction Format), <a href="http://www.infosun.fim.uni-passau.de/Graphlet/GML/"> GML</a>,
            <a
                    href="http://cgi5.cs.rpi.edu/research/groups/pb/punin/public_html/XGMML/">
                XGMML</a>, <a href="http://www.biopax.org/">BioPAX</a>,
            <a href="http://www.psidev.info/index.php?q=node/60">PSI-MI</a>,
            <a href="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/">GraphML</a>,
            <a href="http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/xml/">KGML (KEGG XML)</a>,
            <a href="http://sbml.org/Main_Page">SBML</a>, <a href="http://www.obofoundry.org/">OBO</a>,
            and <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/GO.format.annotation.shtml">Gene Association</a>.
            Delimited text files and MS Excel&#8482; Workbook are also supported and you can import
            data files, such as expression profiles or <a href="http://www.geneontology.org">GO</a> annotations,
            generated by other applications
            or spreadsheet programs. Using this feature, you can load and save arbitrary attributes
            on nodes, edges, and networks. For example, input a set of custom annotation terms for
            your proteins, create a set of confidence values for your protein-protein interactions.

        <h4>Web Service Clients</h4>

        <p>
            <img src="images/intro_4.png"/>
        </p>

        <p>
            Cytoscape works as a web service client. This means Cytoscape can directly connect to
            the external public databases and imports network and annotation data. Currently, <a
                href="http://www.pathwaycommons.org/pc/">Pathway Commons</a>, <a
                href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/site/index.jsf">IntAct</a>, <a
                href="http://www.biomart.org/">BioMart</a>,
            and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene">NCBI Entrez Gene</a>
            are supported. And we continue to
            develop new service clients for popular databases.

        <h4>Interoperability</h4>

        <p>
            <img src="images/intro_5.png"/>
        </p>

        <p>
            Since Cytoscape supports import/export standard file formats, you can easily put Cytoscape
            into your workflow. For example, if you have a network data generated by
            <a href="http://cneurocvs.rmki.kfki.hu/igraph/">igraph</a> or
            <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/GraphsAndNetworks.html">Bioconductor</a>,
            Cytoscape can load the file as a text table and you can export it in PSI-MI format for
            other bioinformatics tools or your own applications/scripts.

            You can save your work by a single click. All of settings, data files, and visualizations
            are packed in a session file. It is called <i>Cytoscape Session (.cys) file</i>.
            Cytoscape Session file includes networks, attributes (for node/edge/network), Desktop
            states (selected/hidden nodes and edges, window sizes), Properties, some plugin states,
            and Visual Styles.

            data to identify connected sets of interactions, i.e. <i>interaction subnetworks</i>, whose genes
            show
            particularly high levels of differential expression. &nbsp;The interactions contained in each
            subnetwork
            provide hypotheses for the regulatory and signaling interactions in control of the observed
            expression
            changes. <strong>Find clusters (highly interconnected regions)</strong> in any network loaded into
            Cytoscape. Depending on the type of network, clusters may mean different things. For instance,
            clusters in a
            protein-protein interaction network have been shown to be protein complexes and parts of pathways.
            Clusters
            in a protein similarity network represent protein families.
