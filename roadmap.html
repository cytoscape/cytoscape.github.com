            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class="narrow">Cytoscape was initially released in 2002, and has undergone numerous
                    development sprints. The most recent major sprint ended in 2014 with the
                    release of Cytoscape v3, which refactored major internal data models and
                    greatly improved support for third party plugin applications (via the
                    App Store, semantic versioning disciplines, published APIs, and code
                    management via OSGi).</p>

                <p>Since v3, we have focused on addressing
                    outstanding bugs and upgrading a number of user-facing features,
                    including visual styles (VizMapper), fast node filtering, network
                    capacity, and overall speed and UI consistency. The Cytoscape app
                    developer community has upgraded a number of v2 plugins into v3 apps,
                    and has contributed a steady stream of new apps
                    (apps.cytoscape.org).</p>

                <p>As of early 2015, our efforts have been
                    rewarded, as Cytoscape has become more popular than ever –
                    <a href="stat.html">14,000 downloads per month
                        worldwide</a>.</p>

                <p>This page explains our roadmap for future
                    deliveries and activities. Feel free to contribute to this discussion
                    via e-mail at <a
                            href="mailto:cytoscape-discuss@googlegroups.com">cytoscape-discuss@googlegroups.com</a>.</p>

                <p class="narrow">Cytoscape is going down a number of roads
                    simultaneously:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Cytoscape Desktop</li>
                    <li>Cytoscape Cyberinfrastructure</li>
                    <li>Cytoscape Community Outreach</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For now, this page describes the Cytoscape Desktop (aka Cytoscape) roadmap.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-9">
                <h2>Vision: Cytoscape Core and Core Apps</h2>

                <p class="narrow">Before v3.3, we viewed Cytoscape as
                    consisting of the Cytoscape Core as augmented by the Cytoscape Apps. As of v3.3,
                    we have created a middle ground: the Cytoscape Core Apps. The Core is the code
                    that organizes, displays, reads, and writes networks but is agnostic as to
                    network meaning or use – the Core does not contain biology-related
                    functionality. Cytoscape Core Apps are installable modules that perform
                    non-Core functions but are still integral to most Cytoscape usage (e.g., network biology).</p>


                <div class="centering">
                    <img src="images/roadmap/core-picture.png">
                    <h4>Fig. 1: Cytoscape Desktop</h4>
                </div>


                <p class="narrow">To date, a Cytoscape release has consisted of the Core +
                    Core Apps (Fig. 1). Beginning in v3.3, the Core Apps are available individually in the
                    App Store, though they are all installed with the Core when Cytoscape is
                    installed. However, unlike previous Cytoscape versions, Core Apps are
                    upgradable without releasing all of Cytoscape. (For example, bugs can be fixed
                    or features can be added to the Network Merge at any time.) This enables the
                    Cytoscape team to upgrade specific features much more quickly than in the past.
                    Additionally, because the Core is much smaller, too, Cytoscape Desktop itself
                    can be released more frequently, too.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12">
                <h2>Policies and Practices</h2>

                <p>Consequently, we have the following policies, subject to periodic change:</p>

                <p style='margin-left:.5in'><b><u>P1:</u></b>
                    Past releases of Cytoscape Desktop have been made
                    roughly every 12 months, with minor releases for bug fixes and minor features
                    occurring every 3-6 months. Beginning with v3.3, a new version of Cytoscape
                    Desktop is released every six months (~April 15 and ~November 15), with updates
                    of Core Apps to the App Store on an as-needed basis. </p>

                <p style='margin-left:.5in'><b><u>P2:</u></b> A high risk Core feature (which could substantially
                    affect overall usability or which are impossible to definitively verify) must
                    be built into the Core eight weeks before the Core is released,
                    or the feature will be carried over to the next Core release. </p>

                <p style='margin-left:.5in'><b><u>P3:</u></b> Other features must be built into the Core five weeks
                    before Core release. </p>

                <p style='margin-left:.5in'><b><u>P4:</u></b> Bug fixes may be performed (with proper review) up to
                    ten days before Core release. </p>

                <p style='margin-left:.5in'><b><u>P5:</u></b> An external API must be frozen, documented, and with
                    preliminary implementations eight weeks before the Core is released, or the API
                    will be carried over to the next Core release. </p>

                <p style='margin-left:.5in'><b><u>P6:</u></b> Milestone builds are created and made available to the
                    user and app developer community eight weeks, five weeks, and ten days before a
                    Core release. If bugs need to be fixed, features need to be withdrawn before
                    the release, or developers see a good reason, additional milestone builds are
                    created.</p>

                <p style='margin-left:.5in'><b><u>P7:</u></b> Milestone builds (including nightly builds) are made
                    available via a developer Download page on the Cytoscape web site.</p>

                <p style='margin-left:.5in'><b><u>P8:</u></b> Emerging API definitions (or references to definitions)
                    are posted on the developer Download page, too.</p>

                <p style='margin-left:.5in'><b><u>P9:</u></b> A preliminary feature list is published five months
                    prior to a Core release, and is updated periodically until ten days before a
                    Core release, at which time it is frozen.</p>

                <p style='margin-left:.5in'><b><u>P10:</u></b> Notably, Cytoscape has
                    expanded beyond its role as a desktop application by also exposing
                    Cytoscape functionality to external control via automation features
                    (also known as Cytoscape as a Service). Feature and workflow testing
                    is performed to a large degree through external scripting (e.g.,
                    PyUnit tests driven by Python). </p>

                <h2>Vision: Key Workflows</h2>

                <p class="narrow">A top priority for Cytoscape
                    development is to enable efficient execution of new and existing key workflows,
                    including:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Cytoscape Main (core network analysis)</li>
                    <li>Network analysis of proteomics data</li>
                    <li>Pathway analysis of gene expression data</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="narrow">Functionality that implements the Core Apps feature is
                    used to enable the user to customize Cytoscape quickly and easily to implement
                    various workflows. Using a Meta-App (i.e., an app that represents multiple apps),
                    the user can install all apps needed to execute the Functional Enrichment workflow.</p>

                <h2>Vision: Integration with Cytoscape Cyberinfrastructure</h2>

                <p class="narrow">As a member of the Cytoscape Cyberinfrastructure (CI),
                    Cytoscape exchanges networks with a number of CI services, including NDEx and
                    viewers based on cytoscape.js.</p>

                <p>One long term vision is to tightly integrate Cytoscape and
                    NDEx so that users naturally load and store their networks using the NDEx
                    service. This enables seamless sharing of networks between Cytoscape and other
                    CI services (e.g., Network Based Stratification), and with other users and
                    publishers. Upon startup, Cytoscape will enumerate the NDEx networks best
                    suited for the user’s use, including networks previously saved by the user
                    and/or the user’s NDEx-based groups, networks pertinent to the user’s interest
                    (e.g., by species, curation properties, etc), or
                    other networks proposed by a recommendation engine. Cytoscape and NDEx will
                    cooperate to make sampling of networks nearly costless so as to encourage
                    exploration (e.g., by caching and displaying network layouts and statistics).
                    Finally, once selected, Cytoscape and NDEx will cooperate to make network loads
                    fast enough that users can remain on task. This vision will initially be
                    realized by a new Core App that replaces the Welcome screen with a panel (a
                    sibling of Network and Select panels) that presents NDEx networks and serves as
                    a jumping off point for workflow execution.</p>

                <p>Cytoscape currently exports a network as a file that can be
                    used as supplemental material for a journal article. A journal publisher’s
                    online article viewer is free to display the network in an interactive viewer,
                    which allows the user to zoom into the network and move nodes. In our vision,
                    advanced viewers may perform lookups on selected nodes and show the results in
                    windows, perform new layouts and network analysis/clustering, and export the
                    network to NDEx for integration with Cytoscape and other services – the network
                    would be furnished to the publisher via NDEx directly from Cytoscape instead as
                    a file in supplementary data. Currently, Elsevier offers a simple viewer that
                    accepts a network file and allows zooming and node movement:</p>
